Typhon, the synchronizing ebook reader for Android
========================================================

Typhon is a free, open-source ebook reader that allows you to keep your reading progress synchronized across multiple devices.
This means you can read a few pages on your phone, than grab your tablet continuing where you left off.

It is a fork of PageTurner ( http://www.pageturner-reader.org/ ) and it adds a feature for Japanese dictionary lookup.

The lookup code takes its root on JadeReader. I recycled the Android specific code and made another 
project for the dictionary lookup called JRikai.

Typhon is licensed under the GPL-V3 license.

    if [ $(uname -m) == 'x86_64' ]; then
        export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre
    else
        export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386/jre

# Gradle

Typhon is built using Gradle. If you want to use a local Gradle version, make sure it's at least version 2.9.
The preferred way is to run the Gradle wrapper. This will automatically download the correct version of gradle to your system.

Run the Gradle wrapper by running

    gradlew

# Build Typhon
Once everything is in place you can build Typhon and install it on your device with 

    gradlew build
    gradlew installDebug
